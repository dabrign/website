# Welcome

## Me

A quick run-down about me:

:computer: I'm a proud Pythonista:snake: specializing in
high-performance backend web services. Python 3, asyncio, and typing
are my jam.

:pencil: I'm a science-fiction writer, currently working on a space
opera set in a future where data is the only currency.

:scroll: I'm a lover of Shakespeare and classical text, and run a
private group that gets together weekly all over NYC to read his works
together.
